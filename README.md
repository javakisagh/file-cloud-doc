# file-cloud-doc

documentation of the file cloud project can be edited with swagger-editor e.g. http://editor.swagger.io/#/ 
(just copy-paste content of the swagger.yaml)

or viewed with local instance of swagger ui a little bit tricky becuase swagger.yaml must be converted into swagger.json (by swagger-editor)
then one has to modify index.html of the swagger-ui

to download swagger-ui
```
./gradlew cloneSwaggerUI
```

```
./gradlew runSwaggerUI
```
not working yet properly
